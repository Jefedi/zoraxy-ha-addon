If you want to build your own version of geodb with updated whitelist,
you can go to this repo and get the "GeoFeed + Whois + ASN" version of 
both the IPV4 and IPV6 mapping (the one without -num)

https://github.com/sapics/ip-location-db/tree/main/geolite2-country

And rename it to "gepipv4.csv" and "gepipv6.csv"
